# ui-builder

The general idea is to have a UI builder which can use any CSS framework. Bootstrap or Foundation or similar reminds me of Lego tiny parts that you can use to build something complex. The only thing needed is a certain description of components of framework you want to use.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.


## Plans for the future

* Create a server in order to store/restore/share your work with other or preview it on devices.
* Make it possible to reorder elements inside of DOM-tree preview.
